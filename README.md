The extensive use of social networking sites has transformed how people share and consume information, but it has also made it easier for fake news to proliferate quickly, endangering social stability and public confidence. This study presents
an innovative framework for detecting fake news by integrating
context-aware sentiment analysis with advanced machine learning techniques. The approach uses contextual embeddings and
sentiment polarity scores to identify news stories as either real
or false, utilizing the Indian Fake News Dataset.The effectiveness
of several machine learning and deep learning models, such as
Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, BERT, BART, and Logistic
Regression, in identifying false news was assessed. Among these,
deep learning models, particularly BERT, achieved the highest
accuracy at 92%, significantly outperforming traditional models
such as Logistic Regression (75%) and Gradient Boosting (85%).
The findings emphasize the effectiveness of combining contextaware sentiment analysis with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, positioning BERT as a robust and scalable tool for
combating misinformation in real-time digital ecosystems.
